## Techno-Psychedelia - Machines, Mushrooms, and the Mind

**I. Introduction: A Journey at the Intersection of AI and Altered States**

* Personal background bridging AI, art, psychedelics, and music.
  * Briefly mention early interest in artificial life and genetic algorithms. 
  * Curiously, the time I started formally studying AI was also the time I first extracted DMT using a recipe I found on the internet.
* Optimistic perspective on technology and human consciousness.
* The power of imagination in shaping our future. (Reference situational awareness: [Introduction - SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: The Decade Ahead](https://situational-awareness.ai/))
* But I don't share the vision of a future dominated by superpowers competing for AI dominance and military advantage, as outlined in the *Situational Awareness* essay.
* I'm fundamentally an optimist, and this rapid acceleration of technology fills me with a sense of wonder.  
* This is the journey I want to share with you in this blog post—a journey into the intersection of AI, psychedelics, and the evolving story of consciousness.

**II. The AI Revolution: From Winter to Spring and a New Era of Collaboration**

* **My AI Journey:**  
  * Studied AI in the early 2000s during the "AI winter." 
  * Early work on evolving a neural model of insect path integration using a genetic algorithm. (Reference: Haferlach, T., et al. (2007). Evolving a Neural Model of Insect Path Integration. Adaptive Behavior, 15(3), 231–244. https://doi.org/10.1177/1059712307082080). 
  * The unexpected resurgence of AI in recent years. 
* Experiences on the frontlines of AI development.

  * **Connect to Dennis McKenna:** Reference *The World as we know it has ended*.
* Rapid evolution of AI capabilities.
  * **Connect to Terence McKenna:** Reference "Time is Speeding Up."
* Practical applications: 
  * Democratizing information, enhancing creativity, augmenting human capabilities.
  * LLMs as Accelerators of Expertise:  How AI models like ChatGPT can make us experts in any field, enabling us to learn new skills and knowledge rapidly.
  * Anecdote:  Share your experience using ChatGPT for cooking, demonstrating how it helped you overcome your limitations and expand your culinary repertoire.
* **Navigating the Ethical Labyrinth of AI:**
  * Ethical considerations:
    * Bias in algorithms.
    * Job displacement.
    * AI for surveillance: 
      * **Counterpoint:**  The potential for AI-generated deepfakes to erode trust in video evidence could lead to a resurgence of human-based networks of trust and the use of cryptographic signatures to verify authenticity.  
      * A return to a world where video evidence is not the ultimate arbiter of truth, similar to the past.
      * Revenge porn becomes meaningless
  * **The Dilemma of AI-Generated Child Pornography:** 
    * The challenge of prevention.
    * **Exploring the Potential Impact on Exploitative Markets:**
      * Could AI-generated content satisfy the demand for child pornography without harming real children?
      * The ethical complexities of this scenario: Does reducing harm justify the creation of such content?
      * The potential for AI to disrupt markets based on exploitation: Could it lead to a decline in the demand for real child pornography? 
  * **Anecdote:**  Share your personal reflections and internal conflict about this dilemma. Discuss your commitment to responsible AI development and the steps you've taken (or are considering) to address this issue. 
  * The potential for misuse of AI:
    * AI-generated bioweapons:
      * **Counterpoint:** Information about bioweapons is already accessible within certain circles. AI may make this knowledge more widely available, but the real danger lies in how humans choose to use this information. 
  * **Reinforcement Learning and the Bias Towards Pleasantries:**
    * Discuss the concern that training AI on human feedback (thumbs-up/thumbs-down) might incentivize models to prioritize what we want to hear rather than objective truth. 
* **Empathy in AI Interaction: Personal Insights on Productive Communication**
  * Interacting with AI as a form of cross-cultural communication.
  * The importance of understanding AI's unique strengths and limitations.
  * The "jagged technological frontier" concept. (Reference: "Centaurs and Cyborgs on the Jagged Frontier," 2023)
  * **Prompt Engineering: Hacking the AI Mind** 
    * How subtle changes in prompts can dramatically affect AI outputs. 
    * Example: Adding phrases like "masterpiece," "4k high resolution," and "prize-winning photo" to image generation prompts improves quality. 
    * Treating AI as an expert by suggesting expertise in a topic enhances responses. 
    * The strange effectiveness of "threatening" or "bribing" AI models (e.g., implying negative consequences for poor answers or promising rewards for good ones). 
    * **Jailbreaking Examples:** Share your experiments with jailbreaking an image generator and chatbots. For instance, using a clever prompt to make ChatGPT roleplay as DAN, which bypasses its usual restrictions ([source](https://www.snexplores.org/article/chatbot-jailbreaks-bad-ai)). Another example is the incident where a chatbot at a Chevy dealership provided incorrect information due to a jailbreak ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ai-chevy-dealership-chatgpt-bot-customer-service-fail-1851111825)). Similarly, Air Canada had to honor a refund policy invented by a chatbot ([source](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/)).
