## I. Introduction and Personal Journey

It's hard to say exactly when my fascination with intelligence began. It feels like it's always been there, this curiosity about how minds work, about the spark of awareness that animates the world around us, and the potential for technology to create something entirely new.  

As a teenager, I was drawn to the idea of artificial life, of simulating life-like processes with code.  I found myself immersed in the world of genetic algorithms, those programs that try to replicate the processes of biological evolution. Creating systems that could learn and adapt was a thrilling challenge.  It wasn't easy to get it right, but that was part of the appeal.

[Here you could add a brief anecdote about a specific experience with genetic algorithms, perhaps one that captures the sense of discovery or the unexpected results you encountered.]

Curiously, the time I started formally studying AI in my early twenties was also the time I first extracted DMT using a recipe I found on the internet. It was the start of a parallel journey, into the depths of the human mind and the possibilities of artificial intelligence.  This was back in the early 2000s, during the so-called "AI winter"—a time when funding was scarce, progress seemed to have stalled, and the field felt a bit like a forgotten backwater.  

But in recent years, something shifted. AI suddenly exploded back onto the scene, more powerful than anyone had predicted.  It's been wild to witness this resurgence, to see the incredible things AI is capable of now.  

I'm fundamentally an optimist, and this rapid acceleration of technology fills me with a sense of wonder.  It feels like we’re on the verge of something truly profound, something that could reshape our understanding of intelligence and consciousness itself. As Dennis McKenna so aptly put it in his blog post, "The World as We Know It Has Ended," the old ways of doing things are crumbling, and we're entering a new era of change and possibility. 

But I believe that technology, if we guide it wisely, has the potential to enhance human consciousness and help us create a more equitable world. But I don't share the vision of a future dominated by superpowers competing for AI dominance and military advantage, as outlined in the *Situational Awareness* essay. I'm drawn to a different path, one where AI empowers individuals, sparks creativity, and helps us connect with the intelligence that already exists all around us—in nature, in other life forms, and perhaps even within the fabric of reality itself.  

This is the journey I want to share with you in this blog post—a journey into the intersection of AI, psychedelics, and the evolving story of consciousness.
